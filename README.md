# Minecraft Router

Hi
This is a router for minecraft servers, so you can redirect clients to specific servers 
depending on the domain they are using to access the server.  
I am new to the concept of Buffers in node.js, so I'm reusing code of a similar project by Minekloud. 

## Minecraft Gateway by Minekloud
The code for the basic functionality is based on the [Minecraft Gateway by Minekloud](https://gitlab.com/minekloud/minecraft-gateway).  
Unfortunately that project has some issues, so I'm trying to fix them here.
